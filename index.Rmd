## Introduction
<br/>
This work is the week 3 assignment for the Data Products course by John Hopkins University on Coursera, as part of their Data Science Specialization.  
<br/>
# BRICS 
<br/>
BRICS is the acronym for an association of five major emerging national economies: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.  
<br/>
The chart at the end of this presentation aims to compare the Universities from this five countries, featured in the Center for World University Rankings.

## Data

The data used comes from the Center for World University Rankings and can be found <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mylesoneill/world-university-rankings">here</a>.

The comparison performed here takes in account the following features:
  1. Publications
  2. Alumni Employment
  3. Final score
  
It is important to notice that in the original dataset, the features, except the final score, are ranked based, meaning that a lower value means a better rank. To make this analysis more intuitive, the features were scaled from 0 to 100, in which a higher value means a better rank.
