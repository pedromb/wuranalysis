## Data

The data used comes from the Center for World University Rankings and can be found <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mylesoneill/world-university-rankings">here</a>.

The comparison performed here takes in account the following features:
  1. Publications
  2. Alumni Employment
  3. Final score
  
It is important to notice that in the original dataset, the features, except the final score, are ranked based, meaning that a lower value means a better rank. To make this analysis more intuitive, the features were scaled from 0 to 100, in which a higher value means a better rank.
